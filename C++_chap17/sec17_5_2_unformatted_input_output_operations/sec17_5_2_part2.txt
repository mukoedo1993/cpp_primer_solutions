Putting back onto an input stream
1: peek returns a copy of the next character stream but does not change the stream. The value returnsed by peek stays on the stream
2:unget backs up the input stream so that whatever value was last returned is still on the stream. We can call unget even if we do not
know what value was last taken from the stream. 
3:putback is a more specified version of unget: It returns the last value read from the stream but takes an argument that must be the same as
the one was last read.
