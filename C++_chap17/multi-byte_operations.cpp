    //actions are similar but not identical. In each case, sink is a char array
    //into which the data are placed. The function read until one of the following conditions
    //occur.
    //1: size-1 characters are read
    //2: End-of-file encountered
    //3: The delimiter character is encountered
    //Difference:
    //get leaves the delimiter as the next character of the istream, whereas getline
    //reads and discards the delimiter, in either case, the delimiter is not stored in sink.
