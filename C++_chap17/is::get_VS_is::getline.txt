is.get(sink,size,delim)
Reads up to size bytes from is and stores them in the character array beginning at the
address pointed to by sink. Reads until encountering the delim character or until
it has read size bytes or encounters end-of-file. If delim is present, it is left on the input
stream and not read into sink.

is.getline(sink, size, delim)
Same behavior as the three-argument version of get but read and discards delim.
