Q17_31: What would happen if we defined b and e inside the do loop of the game-playing program from this section?
A:Because engines return the same sequence of numbers, it is essential that we declare engines outside of loops. Otherwise, we'd create
a new engine on each iteration and generate the same values on each iteration. Similarly, distributions may retain state and should also be
defined outside loops.

Q17_32: What would happen if we defined resp inside the loop?
A: It will become much more difficult to define the string.
