exercise 6.15:
Explain the rationale for the type of each of find_char's parameters. 
1:In particular, why is s a reference to const but occurs is a plain reference? 
2:Why are these paramters references, but the char parameter c is not? 
3:What would happen if we made s a plain reference? 
4: What if we made occurs a reference to const?
1£º s and occurs are both referecnes to avoid copy.

2£º s is const because it isn't changed inside function and a string literal can be used here. occurs is plain reference beacuse it is used to pass information (changed inside function).

3£ºc is nonreference because copy a char is very cheap. It's fine to make it a const reference but not plain reference, because we don't want to accidentally change c inside function, and we may want to pass a char literal to the function.

4£º If occurs is made a reference to const, then we cannot get how many times the character c occurred in string
