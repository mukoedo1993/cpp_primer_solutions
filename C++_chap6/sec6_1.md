A function definition typically consists of a return type, a name, a list of zero or more parameters, and a body. The parameters are specified in a comma-separated
list enclosed in paratheses.
# NAME vs Local Object:

# Automatic Object:
Objects that exist only while a block is executing are known as automatic objects.

Local Ob theject:
Each local static object is initialized before the first time execution passes through the object's definition. Local statics ar enot destroyed when a function ends; they are destroyed when the program terminates.
