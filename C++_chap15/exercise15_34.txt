Q: For the expression:
Query q=

(a):
(i): Query::Query(const string&) three times
(ii):AndQuery::AndQuery(const Query&,const Query&)once. Within AndQuery::AndQuery, Binary::BinaryQuery(const Query&,const Query&).
(iii):Query::Query(shared_ptr<Query_base>query)once.
(iv):OrQuery::OrQuery(const Query&,const Query&)once. Within OrQuery::OrQuery, Binary::BinaryQuery(const Query&,const Query&).
(v):Query::Query(shared_ptr<Query_base>query)once.


(b):
We need to understand that the Query object q, is an object of Query which holds a pointer to OrQuery object.
This OrQuery object's lhs, rhs, are both Query objects.  lhs's q is a shared_ptr to AndQuery, rhs'q is shared_ptr to WordQuery object(we call it mkft1 afterwards).
lhs'q 

(c):
It calls its member's q's q->eval(), and then, it calls AndQuery's eval, which returns a object of QueryResult.
