Q: What is the difference between an ordinary function pointer and a pointer to member function?
Soln.: Pointers to member functions are not like regular pointers to functions, because member functions
have a hidden "this" parameter, and so can only be called if you supply an object to play the role of
"this", and use some special syntax to tell the compiler to set up the call using the hidden “this”
parameter.
