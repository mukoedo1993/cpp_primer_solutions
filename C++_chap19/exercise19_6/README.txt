Basically, I modified code I used in the exercise15_39 to finish this question.
Notice that I changed the visibility of AndQuery's constructor from private to public. Similar work was done for OrQuery's constructor.
It made me to answer this question much easier. Anyway, the focus on this question is to show 
how to do dynamic_cast.
i did all three types. pointer dynamic_cast, lvalue dynamic_cast and rvalue dynamic_cast.
The input and output txt file are MEANINGLESS in this question. But for the completeness of this question, I still uploaded both 
of them.
