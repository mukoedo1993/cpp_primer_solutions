We've seen that, by default, the compiler uses the arguments in a call to determine
the template parameters for a function template.

The process of determining the template arguments from the function arguments is known
as template argument deduction. During template deduction, the compiler uses types of
the arguments in the call to find the template arguments that generate a version of the
function that best matches the given call.
