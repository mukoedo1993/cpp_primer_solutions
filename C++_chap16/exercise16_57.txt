Q:Compare your variadic version of errorMsg to the error_msg function in p.220. WHat are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

A:
errorMsg, variadic template function, is much more flexible, which allows data of different types as parameters.
But, error_msg, is much less flexible, they are put into a initializer_list, so they must have same type or at least convertible.
