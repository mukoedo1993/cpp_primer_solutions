Q1: What is a function template? What is a class template?
A: A function template is a formula from which we can generate type-specific versions of that function.



Q2: WHat happened when a class template is instantiated?
A: When we use a class template, we must supply extra information. We can now see that extra information is a list of 
explicit template arguments that are bound to instantiate a specific class from the template.
