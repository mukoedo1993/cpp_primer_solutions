Each constructor uses its constructor initializer list to initialize its data member to point to a dynamically allocated vector.

The default constructor allocates an empty vector:
//lue4

//The constructor that takes an initializer_list passes its parameter to the coresponding vector constructor. That constructor initializes the vector's elements
by copying the values in the list.
