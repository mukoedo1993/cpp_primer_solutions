Q: We did not make the constructor that takes an initializer_list explicit.(Page 296). Discuss the pros and cons of this design.
A：Pros:
1: The compiler will not use automatic conversion.
2： We could understand clearly what we have done, which class we have used.

B: cons:
1: We will always use the constructor to create a temporary Strblob object.
2: cannot use the copy form of initialization with an explicit constructor. Difficult to use.
