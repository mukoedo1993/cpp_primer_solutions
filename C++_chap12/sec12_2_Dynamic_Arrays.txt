Dynamic Arrays:

The new and delete operators allocate objects one at a time.
Some applications, need the ability to allocate storage for many objects at once.

e.g.1:
Vectors and strings store their elements in contiguous memory and must allocate several elements 
at once whenever the container has to be allocated.
1: new: to allocate abd initialize an array of objects.
2: allocation: let us separate allocation from initialization.
