Ordered v Unordered Associative Containers
Ordered Associative Container
1:Standard Traversal encounters elements in sorted order
2:Order predicate may be specified
3:Default order predicate is "less than"(ascending), defined using operator< for the element type
4:Popular implementations: OrderedVector, BinarySearchTree
5:Search operations required to have O(log n) runtime
6:Insert, Remove operations should either be seldom used or have O(log n) runtime


Unordered Associative Container
1:Standard Traversal encounters elements in unspecified order
2:Search, Insert, Remove operations should have average-case constant runtime
3:Popular implementations use hashing
