A vector is an normal sequnetial container which contains a normal array of values. Values are found by position. The position is an integer.

vector: every time when a dynamic array is required.
deque: add or delete element on the front or back is required.
map: dictionary
set: to check the existence(e.g. the namelist of people who issued bad checks.).
