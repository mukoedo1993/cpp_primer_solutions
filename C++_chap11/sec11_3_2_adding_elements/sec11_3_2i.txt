From their founding in the 17th century, the colonies 
were largely left to govern themselves. As conflict with New France expanded, 
the costs of their defense increased; after the eviction of France from North America in 1763, 
Parliament and the colonies disputed how these expenses should be paid.[34] Measures like the 1765 
Stamp Act to increase government revenues provoked unrest that culminated in the 1773 Boston Tea Party. 
When Parliament responded by imposing punitive measures on Massachusetts,
the other twelve colonies set up the First Continental Congress, which agreed to boycott British goods.[m]
