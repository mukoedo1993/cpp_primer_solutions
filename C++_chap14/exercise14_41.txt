Question: Why do you suppose the new standard added lambda? Explain when would you se a lambda and when you would write a class instead?

Solution:
 lambda is quite handy to use. Lambda can be used when the functor is not used frequently nor complicated, 
 whereas functor is supposed to call more times than lambda or quite complicated to implement as a lambda.
 Conclusion:
 If easy, we prefer to use lambda. Otherwise, a class is a better choice.
