Extra notes:
Differnce between a class containing function-call operator and a lambda_expression: 
1: Classes generated from a lambda expression has a deleted constructor, deleted assignment operators, and a default destructor.

2:Whether the class has a defaulted or deleted copy/move constructor depends in ths usual way on the types of the captured data members.

3:std::find_if
