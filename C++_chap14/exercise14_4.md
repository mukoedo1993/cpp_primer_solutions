**Basic rules:**
*symmetric*: non-member
 operators: = () [] -> must be member
*bitshift*: non-member
 *changing state of objects*: member
 
 **Hence, we have:**
 (a) symmetric operator. Hence, non-member

(b) changing state of objects. Hence, member

(c) changing state of objects. Hence, member

(d) = () [] -> must be member

(e) non-member

(f) symetric , non-member

(g) symetric , non-member

(h) = () [] -> must be member
