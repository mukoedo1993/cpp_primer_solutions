An arithmetc operator usually generates a new value that is the result of a computation on its two oeprands.

1: The value is distinct from either operand and its calculated in a local variable.
2: THe operation returns a copy of this local as its result.
3: classes that define an arithmetic operator generally define the corresponding compound assignment operator as well
4: If a class has both operators, more efficient to define the arithmetic operator to use compound assignment.
