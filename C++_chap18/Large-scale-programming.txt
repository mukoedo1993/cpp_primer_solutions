Large-scale programming places greater demands on programming languages than do the needs of systems that can be developed by
small teams of programmers. Among the needs that distinguish large-scale applications are:
1: The ability to handle errors across independently developed subsystems
2: The ability to use libraries developed more or less independently
3: The ability to model more complicated application concepts
