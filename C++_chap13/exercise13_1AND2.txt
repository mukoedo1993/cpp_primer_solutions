Q1: What is a copy constructor? When is it used?
A1: A constructor is the copy constructor if its first parameter is a reference to the class type and any additional parameters have default values.
A2:(a):=(b):Pass an object as an argument to a parameter of nonreference type
(c):return an object from a function that has a nonreference return type
(d): Brace initialize the elements in an array or the members of an aggregate class


Q2: Explain why the folloding declaration is illgeal:
Sales_data::Sales_data(Sales_data rhs);

A: The fact that the copy constructor is used to initialize nonreference parameters of class type explains why the copy constructor's
own parameter must be a reference. If that parameter were not a reference, then the call would never succeed--to call the copy constructor,
 we'd need to use the copy constructor to copy the argument, but to copy the argument, we'd need to call the copy constructor, and so on indefinitely.
