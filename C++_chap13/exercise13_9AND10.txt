exercise 13_9:
Q1:What is a destructor? Q2:What does the synthesized destructor do? Q3:When is a destructor synthesized?
A1: Destructors do whatever work is needed to free the resources used by an object and destroy the nonstatic data members of the object.
A2://The destructor operates inversely to the constructors:
//1: Constructors initialize the nonstatic data members of an object and may do other work;
//2:destructors do whatever work is needed to free the resources used by an object and destroy the
//nonstatic data members of the object.
//3: In a destructor, the function body is executed first and then the members are destroyed. Members
// are destroyed in reverse order from the order in which they were initialized.
A3: For any class that does not define its own destructor.

exercise 13_10:
Q:What happens when a StrBlob object is destroyed? What about a StrBlobPtr?
A:
When a StrBlob object destroyed, the use_count of the dynamic object will decrement. It will be freed if no shared_ptr to that dynamic object.
When a StrBlobPter object is destroyed the object dynamically allocated will not be freed.
