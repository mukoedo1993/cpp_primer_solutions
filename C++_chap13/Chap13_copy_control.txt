When we define a class, we specify--explicitly or implicitly--what happens when objects of that class type
are copied, moved, assigned, and destroyed. A class controls these operations by defining five special member functions.
1: copy constructor
2: copy-assignment operator
3: move constructor
4: move-assignment constructor
5: destructor

1: The copy and move constructors define what happens when an object is initialized from another object of the same type.
2: The copy and move-assignment operators define what happens when we assign an object of a class type to another object of
that same class type.
3:The destructor defines what happens when an object of the type ceases to exist.
4:copy-control: these operations
