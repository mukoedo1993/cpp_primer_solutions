exercise 13.6:
Q1: What is a copy-assignment operator? 
Q2:When is this operator used? 
Q3: What does the synthesized copy-assignment operator do?
Q4: When is it synthesized?
A1: =
A2: It is used when we assign value to an object.
A3:It assigns each nonstatic member of the right-hand object to the corresponding member of the left-hand object using the copy-assignment operator
for the type of that member.
A4: If the class does not define its own.

A1:When we assign one StrBlob to another, the underlying smart pointer is copyed. 
But the vector to which the pointer pointed is not copyed, which means both StrBlob objects will use the same vector. This may not be what we want.
A2:
