To move an object rather than copy one:
In some cases, an object is immediately destroyed after it is copied.
In these cases, moving rather than copying--->can provide a siginificant performance boost.

Reason1: there is no need
2:somce classes(such as IO or unique_ptr) may not be shared. Hence, objects of these types can't be copied but can be moved.
