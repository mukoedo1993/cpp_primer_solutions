Q: We did not use copy and swap to define  the Message assignment operator. Why do you suppose this is so?
A: In this case, swap function is special. First, two folders are cleared, then swap members, and add themselves to each folder.
But, Message assignment operator just clear itself, and copy their members, and add itself to each folder. The rhs doesn't need to
clear and add folders. So, if using and swap to define, it will be very inefficient.
