exercise 13_47TO48 gives a link on a String( C-style string) class. Please see the String_best_soln directory.
exericse 13_49AND50 is included in sec13.6.2 directory.
copy constructor should take a const reference.

Exercise 13_58's solution is omitted. Because I have already done the work required in previous two exercises.

I add a test to show, bascially, in three difference cases:
call either sorted()const& or sorted()&&?
If the object is taken as a const rvalue, or lvalue or rvalue?
