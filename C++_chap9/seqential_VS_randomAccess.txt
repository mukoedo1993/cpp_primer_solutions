1:
Sequential access means the cost of accessing the 5th element is 5 times the cost of accessing the first element, 
or at least that there is an increasing cost associated with an elements position in the set. 
This is because to access the 5th element of the set, you must first perform an operation to find the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th elements, 
so accessing the 5th element requires 5 operations.


2:
Random access means that accessing any element in the set has the same cost as any other element in the set. 
Finding the 5th element of a set is still only a single operation.
