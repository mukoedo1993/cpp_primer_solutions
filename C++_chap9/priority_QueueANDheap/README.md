Priority_queue
A priority queue is an abstract data type (ADT) that operates similar to a normal queue except that each elements has a certain priority.
The priority of the elements in the priority determine the order in which elements are removed from the PQ.

NOTE: priority queues only support comparable data.

Heap
A heap is a tree based DS that satisfies the heap invariant (also called heap property): If A is a parent node of B then A is ordered with respect to
B for all nodes A, B in the heap.
